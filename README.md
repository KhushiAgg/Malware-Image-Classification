# Malware Image Classification
 This notebook consists of comparison analysis of different transfer learning models for malware image classification.

## Dataset Used
We have used the Malimg Dataset. The Malimg Dataset contains 9349 malware images, belonging to 25 families/classes. Thus, our goal is to perform a multi-class classification of malware and then comparing the results of different transfer learning models to find out which one gave the best accuracy.

Following classes of malware are there in the dataset:

* Adialer.C
* Agent.FYI
* Allaple.A
* Allaple.L
* Alueron.gen!J
* Autorun.K
* C2LOP.P
* C2LOP.gen!g
* Dialplatform.B
* Dontovo.A
* Fakerean
* Instantaccess
* Lolyda.AA1
* Lolyda.AA2
* Lolyda.AA3
* Lolyda.AT
* Malex.gen!J
* Obfuscator.AD
* Rbot!gen
* Skintrim.N
* Swizzor.gen!E
* Swizzor.gen!I
* VB.AT
* Wintrim.BX
* Yuner.A

The models used for malware image classification were:

* VGG16
* VGG19
* RESNET-50
* INCEPTION-V3

Comparative Analysis of the accuracies of each model without fine-tuning vs with fine-tuning was performed. The best-performing model for the task of malware image classification was VGG16 with fine-tuning which gave an accuracy of around 98.33%.
