# Malware Image Classification
 These notebook consists of comparison analysis of different transfer learning models for malware image classification.

## Dataset Used
We have used the Malimg and Malevis Dataset. The Malimg Dataset contains 9349 malware images, belonging to 25 families/classes and Malevis Dataset containing 26 software classes with 1 class being legitimate or benign and 25 classes corresponding to different types of malwares. Thus, our goal is to perform a multi-class classification of malware and then comparing the results of different transfer learning models to find out which one gave the best accuracy.

Following classes of malware are there in the MalImg dataset:

* Adialer.C
* Agent.FYI
* Allaple.A
* Allaple.L
* Alueron.gen!J
* Autorun.K
* C2LOP.P
* C2LOP.gen!g
* Dialplatform.B
* Dontovo.A
* Fakerean
* Instantaccess
* Lolyda.AA1
* Lolyda.AA2
* Lolyda.AA3
* Lolyda.AT
* Malex.gen!J
* Obfuscator.AD
* Rbot!gen
* Skintrim.N
* Swizzor.gen!E
* Swizzor.gen!I
* VB.AT
* Wintrim.BX
* Yuner.A

Following classes of malware are there in the MaleVis dataset:

* Adopshel
* Agent
* Allaple
* Amonetize
* Androm
* Autorun
* BrowseFox
* Dinwod
* Elex
* Expiro
* Fasong
* HackMS
* Hlox
* Injector
* InstallCore
* MultiPlug
* Neoreklami
* Nestha
* Other
* Regrun
* Sality
* Snarasite
* Stantinko
* VBA
* VBKrypt
* Vilsel

The models used for malware image classification were:

* VGG16
* VGG19
* RESNET-50
* INCEPTION-V3
and Their Fine-tuned models

Comparative Analysis of the accuracies of each model without fine-tuning vs with fine-tuning was performed. The best-performing model for the task of malware image classification for MalImg Dataset was VGG16 with fine-tuning which gave an accuracy of around 98.33% and for Malevis Dataset were VGG19 and InceptionV3 both with 94.17% accuracy.
